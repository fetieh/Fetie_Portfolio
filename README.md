# Fetie's Personal Portfolio

## Introduction

This README provides an overview of the changes made to the portfolio website to meet the specified requirements. The changes aim to enhance the user experience, make the website more interactive, and ensure responsive design for various screen sizes and devices.

## Features

1. **Navigation Links:** The page presents my name as a Logo, a recent photo of mine, and links to sections about me, my works, and how to contact me.

2. **Smooth Scrolling:** When one of the links in the navigation is clicked, the UI smoothly scrolls to the corresponding section on the page (e.g., "About Me," "My Works," or "Contact Me"), improving the overall user experience.

3. **Work Section:** The "Work" section now contains titled images of my applications, providing visitors with a visual representation of my work.

4. **Application Image Sizing:** When presented with the first application, that application's image is larger in size than the others, creating a focal point for my portfolio.

5. **Deployed Application Links:** When images of the applications are clicked, users are taken to the respective deployed applications, allowing them to explore my work more deeply.

6. **Responsive Design:** The layout is responsive and adapts to various screen sizes and devices, ensuring that the website looks and functions well on all platforms.
